### makeInMemoryStore ( store )
makeInMemoryStore is a module designed to provide an efficient in-memory data storage solution, specifically intended to replace storage functionalities that might have been removed or altered from the original Baileys project. This module allows your application to quickly manage and access session data in memory, making it an ideal choice for development and testing, or for use cases where disk data persistence isn't required.

#### Core Functionality
makeInMemoryStore acts as a temporary data store operating entirely within memory. This means all stored data will be lost once the application process terminates.

#### Usage
Installation
Ensure you have the pino module installed if you wish to utilize the recommended logging functionality.

```
npm install pino
```

#### Initialization
To use makeInMemoryStore, you'll need to import and initialize it. You can integrate it with a logging system like pino to monitor storage activities.

Here's an example implementation for your index.js:

```
const makeInMemoryStore = require('./store.js'); // Adjust path if 'store.js' is in a different directory
const pino = require('pino'); // Import pino for logging

const logger = pino({
    level: 'silent' // Set logging level as needed (e.g., 'info', 'debug')
});

const store = makeInMemoryStore({
    logger: logger.child({
        stream: 'store' // Specific stream for store-related logs
    })
});

// Now the 'store' object is ready to manage your in-memory data
// Example: store.read(), store.write(), store.chats.all(), etc.
```

#### Code Explanation
- const makeInMemoryStore = require('./store.js');: This line imports the makeInMemoryStore function from the store.js file located in the same directory. Make sure this file path is correct.
- const logger = pino({ level: 'silent' });: This initializes a logger instance from pino. You can change the level from 'silent' to 'info', 'debug', or any other level based on your desired log verbosity.
- const store = makeInMemoryStore({...});: This calls makeInMemoryStore to create an in-memory storage instance.
- logger: logger.child({ stream: 'store' }): This is an optional but highly recommended configuration. It associates a dedicated child logger for the store with a stream named 'store', allowing you to filter or direct storage-related logs separately.
